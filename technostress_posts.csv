Technostress from a sociological perspective,"Hey everybody,

I am interested in your thoughts about the (causal) relationship of labor, technology and health from a sociological point of view. There are some works -mostly from other disciplines- that deal with stress triggered by technology using the term ""technostress"" but it seems to me that this term (except in the field of medical sociology) is rarely used in the discipline of sociology. But I am optimistic that (labor) sociology deals with the same issues under different labels. So I am looking for constructs, theories and research-fields that deal with stress triggered by technology.

So far I found mostly papers about role-conflicts and work-life-conflicts.

Thank you very much in advance!",Tims_Clay_Rainbow,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/n6u41n/technostress_from_a_sociological_perspective/,1620377821.0,11,sociology
"How has Technostress, Technology Induced Stress, affect those of you in the field of IT/CS?"," Technostress, defined by Oxford Languages as ""stress or psychosomatic illness caused by working with computer technology on a daily basis"", is a computer induced stress that affects everyone working in the computer science field. Technostress effects range from employees taking their work home, to employees becoming completely burnt-out from their job. With such a large reach, it can be difficult for companies and employers to identify and overcome the ethical hazard.

&#x200B;

In your experience, have you ever been faced with a form of technostress?  Also, do you believe that the workplace duties of an IT professional go beyond the physical workplace environment that you may drive to every morning?",JamesMaki999,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/m3ibra/how_has_technostress_technology_induced_stress/,1615558251.0,5,cscareerquestions

New Research: The Psychological Impact of Digital Transformation on Employee Wellbeing,"We've published findings in IEEE Access examining how the psychological experience of digital transformation affects employee wellbeing.

The research introduces ""digital climate"" as a framework for understanding three key dimensions:

1. User Digital Experience - How employees interact with and adapt to digital tools
2. Digital Process Efficiency - How digital workflows support or hinder employee tasks
3. Organization's Digital Effectiveness - How leadership implements and supports digital solutions

Key findings show that positive digital climate significantly reduces technostress, prevents burnout, and enhances job satisfaction.

This integration of business technology and psychology provides practical guidance for organizations navigating digital change while supporting employee mental health.

"New Research: Introducing ""Digital Climate"" as a Subdimension of Organizational Climate","We've recently published research that extends organizational climate theory by introducing ""digital climate"" as a specific subdimension focused on how employees perceive technology implementation.

Similar to how safety climate or service climate represent shared perceptions in specific domains, digital climate captures how employees view:

* Technology readiness
* Digital resource availability
* Digital leadership support

Our findings from a public sector organization show that digital climate significantly affects employee wellbeing through:

* Technostress reduction
* Burnout prevention
* Job satisfaction enhancement

This conceptualization helps bridge the gap between technical system design and psychological outcomes in increasingly digitalized workplaces.

Seeking advice on re-orienting priorities AWAY from KPIs,"Hi there,

I run L&D associated with tertiary admissions, and one of my jobs is to continually manage refreshers and development of skills for our assessment teams. They are the people who attach digital records, decide what level to classify a qualification at, and basically do all of the verification of information in a university application. For reference this is NOT in the USA, so we have a very different approach and do not consider 'soft' criteria like essays and volunteering in most cases.

Assessment of qualifications is actually really complex for a bunch of reasons that aren't relevant, but we have found ourselves in a position where our assessment teams are making little errors on simple things, even when they are experienced. I have a theory on why this is, and I have narrowed it down to:

1. All of our resources are digital - almost entirely in Confluence, which can appear very uniform, no matter what macros and colours you use around a page. This means that essentially there is no multimedia processing happening. While we have flow charts and diagrams, there is very little that isn't on the screen because it's all CONSTANTLY changing.

2. Scope creep - for every normal situation there are multiple exceptions. Experienced assessors get used to it, but the largest challenge is even recognising/remembering special cases and unique complex procedures exist. There are also courses that have incredibly complex admissions rules that take significant time to assess. There is about 1,000 pages of process documentation for assessors to use, although they are broken down into teams so a single assessor only needs to access about 300-500. Still insane.

3. Hangovers from old team members that speed is important. It is NOT the responsibility of assessors to be concerned with whether we are meeting KPIs for how fast things are being assessed. They are deliberately kept from running the reports, KPIs are not tracked against individuals and there is absolutely no pressure.  However, some team members who have left were very experienced, and used to somewhat compete on numbers, which is contrary to our mantra that 'accuracy is more important than speed.' This habit has definitely continued to quietly influence behaviours.

  
So with that in mind I have some goals:

1. Re-program the thought processes of the teams to value accuracy over speed. How do I do this without running reports on errors? The last thing I want to do is start shaming assessors for errors, when I genuinely feel we have a deeper issue than carelessness or aptitude. Our teams are too small to single out 'accuracy super stars' without shaming others.

2. Introduce some measure to mitigate cognitive overload due to technostress and a lack of multimedia information processing. Can you mandate 5 minute breaks?! We also have remote staff so managing their breaks is also a challenge. We're thinking about going back to old school work sheets for some complex processes such as admission to Master of Psychology courses (what a nightmare).

  
Can I ask what people think of this plan, and do you have any suggestions on whether I am on the right track and ways to meet these goals/mitigate these issues?",LeSpoogeMcDuck,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningDevelopment/comments/1da0h53/seeking_advice_on_reorienting_priorities_away/,1717728898.0,1,LearningDevelopment

Digital Detox: 10 Practical Tips to Free Your Body and Mind from Technological Stress,"The term ""digital detox"" has become increasingly relevant in our modern era, where technology is becoming more and more prevalent in our lives. From the rise of smartphones to constant internet access, we have come to rely heavily on technology in all areas of our lives. This dependence has led to an increase in technological stress, a feeling of anxiety and overload caused by the excessive use of digital devices and constant connection to the internet.  
  
Digital detox is the process of disconnecting from electronic devices and reducing exposure to technology in order to regain a healthy balance between online and offline life. As society progresses towards an increasingly digital era, this concept has become crucial to preserving our mental and physical health.  
  
Technology dependence is one of the modern addictions that most affect people today. Countless accidents of all kinds happen daily because people are unable to disconnect from the digital life when they are performing tasks that require attention and concentration. Technology addiction is not a minor evil. It is actually a growing problem that compromises more and more people's performance in all spaces every day.  
  
This digital intoxication is known since the 80s as ""technostress"". Technostress is a term that refers to stress or anxiety caused by the excessive use of technology, especially digital devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. It was first coined by psychologist Craig Brod in 1984. Brod defined it as ""a state of anxiety produced by the inability to cope with new computer technologies in a healthy way"". Since then, the term has been widely used to describe the negative effects of excessive use of technology on people's mental health and well-being.  
  
Technostress, also known as technological stress, refers to the feeling of anxiety, overload, or discomfort caused by the excessive use of technology at work or in personal life. This term emerged as technology became more omnipresent in our lives, affecting not only how we work but also how we relate to everything around us.  
  
Technostress can manifest in various ways, such as eye strain, headaches, insomnia, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and a feeling of being constantly connected. People experiencing technostress often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information they receive through digital devices and have difficulty disconnecting from these devices and relaxing.

Are computer, digital, online technologies good or evil? I know,   I know such questions cannot be answered with picking just one choice, it is   always “it depends”.

Researchers in positive cyberpsychology area are aiming to   consolidate research areas so we understand how we can increase and ensure human   well-being through interactions with and via technology. It seems that there   is already a rich field of research on the “dark” side. Just like in the early   years of psychology, we see that it is not good to focus only on diseases and   problems, because then we do not understand the whole context. We should not   guess but instead we should clearly know how innovations impact human   behaviour, whether they can make life more worthwhile and how technology   should be designed to support and not damage well-being. Already today it is   important for hybrid systems and human-computer interaction development,   military products, biohacking, Industry 5.0 (concept of very close collaboration   between humans and artificial intelligence, automation, robots), digital user   experience – also online support and digital therapy. Learning from the   history of psychology, even the areas that appear to be focusing on negative   aspects (like digital addictions, technostress, and cyberbullying) would   benefit from positive perspective and help to not only avoid problematic situations   but also strengthen resilience and suggest most efficient ways from   problematic situations to healthy states.

What is your point of view? Is your experience with digital technologies   more on the “dark” side or more positive? Can you share examples?

Each Special move used in the entire series so far (As of Sentinels of light vs Shadow Isles) in order. (WIP),"Crippling Depression (Varus)

First Appearance: New Varus Build

Use: Buffering the Ultimate while flashing to get more range on it

Fun Fact: Varus' special move list is called The Arsenal of Abnormalities

&#x200B;

Psychotic Anxiety

First Appearance: Understanding Botlane

Use: Using flash to curve Pyke's e for style points or to gain more range to catch enemies just out of range

&#x200B;

Autism Zone

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Use: Allows Papa to increase his Chromosomes tenfold for a short amount of time but is useless unless Papa already has a large amount ready.

Fun Fact: The name was later changed to Asberger Syndrome due to Copyright and Papa wanting to make a callback to the Nexus Blitz filler episode and was changed to only be allowed to access one at 80% or more autism level.

&#x200B;

Forgotten Dememtia

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Use: Papa dashes with his E and uses his R to curve the phantom so it hits his opponent.

Fun fact: Papa's strongest solo move in his weapons of disorder. It is so strong that it cannot even be activated without a large source of chromosomes already present.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Pink Pyke Cloak

First Appearance: ppp

Use: While wearing the Pink Pink Cloak Papa gains the power of gayness becoming so powerful that no words in the human vocabulary can describe him forcing the narrator to go silent while Papa wrecks his enemies

Fun Fact: I will be including characters different forms on this List.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Blood Moon Pyke Skin

First Appearance: Blood Moon Pyke

Use: While in this form Papa's chromosome power is boosted however it requires a large amount of chromosomes to remain in this form.

Fun Fact: In order to gain access to this power Papa had to join the Blood Moon Clan and perform the ritual of paying the 5$ lifetime membership fee.

&#x200B;

Crippling Depression (Pyke)

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: Using flash to buffer the use on Pyke's q to get more range.

&#x200B;

Menacing Menpause

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: A 3 hit combo of Q, E backwards, Tiamat (or just a regular AA depending on the season) to proc Electrocute to get his target low enough for an execute with his R.

Fun Fact: This move probably changed the most during the series as its core component of Tiamat and sometimes even Electrocute were removed depending on how viable they were on Pyke. It is also the most usable of Pyke's Weapons of Disorder as it doesn't require flash or too many chromosomes.

&#x200B;

Epileptic Epitaph

First Appearance: Clean Combos

Use: Allows Papa to see 10 seconds into the future. Papa can spend more chromosomes to see farther. Papa must already be at high chromosome levels to use Epileptic Epitaph although the exact level vary based on different translations, manga, or anime.

Fun Fact: Although it first appeared in Clean Combos Epileptic Epitaph was only scarsley used in episodes like The Duty of a Carry, Tenacity Stacking etc. and it didn't even get its name until Auto win at level 16. (It was just called precognative ability until then).

&#x200B;

Chromosome Stealing

First Appearance: BAN SYLAS

Use: Being only usable by a select few characters It allows them ti steal the chromosomes of other characters and gain the power of them.

Fun Fact: This ability was first used by Sylas and is the main reason he is my fav character. No other character (yes even Evil Morde and Evil Papa) made me feel so much dread when they appeared. The way he just ruthlessly stole WhyGuy's chromosomes still gives me chills each time i watch the episode. There are only 3 characters who have demonstrated having innatley having this ability (Sylas, Papa. Evil Papa).

&#x200B;

The Snap

First Appearance: Tenacity Stacking

Use: At the Cost of 50% of the League playerbase WhyGuy can skip his Promos. This only works if Papa has been in The Hardstuck Zone for atleast a month and if Papa recieves a comment asking for more cliffhangers.

&#x200B;

Shining Jaundice

First Appearance: Well Designed Item

Use: Using either the Stopwatch or Zhonya's Hourglass the user's skin becomes golden protecting them from any harm for 2.5.

Fun Fact: Anyone can use this special move and it was used throughout the entire series but first got a name in the episode Well Designed Item.

&#x200B;

Lazy Editing

First Appearance: Return to Masters

Use: At the cost of 88% Autism level WhyGuy can erase the process of a game skipping it entirely.

Fun Fact: Papa's most costly move which has only been used once in the entire series so far.

&#x200B;

Death Realm Warp

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: Usable only by the current Ruler of the Death realm (Currently Mordekaiser) it allowes them to warp themselves and 1 other person into the death realm for 1 on 1 combat within a confined space

Fun fact: It's time for most peoples favorite villain: Evil Mordekaiser! While I personally like Sylas more, the sheer power Mordekaiser presents from here on out towards the entire series unquestionably makes him a very close second.

&#x200B;

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (or ADHD for short)

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: A move created by Papa specifically to counter Morde's Death Realm Warp which puts his body in constant motion becoming UNCONTAINABLE.

Fun Fact: One of Papa's most worthless moves due to only being a counter to 1 specific thing makes this move very low on the Tier List (Yes I will be making a tier list after this) but the fact that someone forced Papa to create an entirely new move speaks volumes for Morde himself. What a shame that this move is very easily countered.

&#x200B;

Tourettic Transition

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: At the cost of Autism Levels Papa can skip anywhere betweeen 10 seconds and 20 minutes of a game.

Fun Fact: Like Epileptic Epitaph this ability appeared a long time before it actually got its name in Harvesting my adversaries with Dark Harvest Pyke.

&#x200B;

Crippling Anxiety

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: A combo move where Papa and Varus combine the moves Crippling Depression and Psychotic Anxiety to form a new even more powerful move.

Fun Fact: This is the very first combo move used in the series and I must say that it's pretty cool.

&#x200B;

Dead Weight

First Appearance: Mordekaiser's Revenge

Use: This move enhances the users desire to strategically iINT without getting banned

Fun Fact: This move is most often used in the series by villains and very rarely by allies of Whydra.

&#x200B;

Radiating Retardation

First Appearance: Dominating with Domination Runes

Use: The users chromosomes increase by 3 for every second that passes while in this state.

Fun Fact: This move can be techincally used even at low Autism Levels but due to it's high cost when you leave this state it's very unsafe to use it while below 90% Autism Levels.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Project Pyke Suit

First Appearance: PROJECT: Pyke

Use: When wearing this cybernetic form Papa stays at a permanent 80% Autism level and has a permanent Epileptic Epitaph installed. The suit also has a built-in casette player and a navigation assistant.

Fun Fact: Papa rarely uses this suit after its first appearance even after it was cleansed of the virus due to the fact that Papa prefers the risk of losing Autism levels for the reward of more than 80% than the safetey of a permanent 80%. Evil WhyGuy also wears a pink chroma on his suit to combine the powers of the PROJECT Suit and the ppc (Pink Pyke Cloak).

&#x200B;

Cybernetic Anxiety

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Psychotic Anxiety.

Fun Fact: We don't know which of the 2 moves is stronger but my guess is it depends on the amount of chromosomes the current user has.

&#x200B;

Technostressing Depression

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Crippling Depression.

&#x200B;

Diminishing Discrimination

First Appearnace: League of Legends makes me sad

Use: After landing her Q Mama smashes her keyboard with utmost finesse dealing massive damage and enlightening teammates that Supports should not be underestimated.

Fun Fact: Mama has decided that instead of focusing on various diffeerent moves for different situations she will just perfect 1 move that can be used in any situation. I am still sad that this means we will most likely never see the other moves in the Feminist Movement though (Whining Wamen, Bobcut buster, Entitled Endurance).

Cultural Appropiration

First Appearance: Swain OP! Must ban instead of Pyke

Use: By becoming a bird himself Papa enducated uncultured 2 birds with his might showing them the power of Swain.

Fun Fact: I only put this on the list due to a YouTube comment as I don't even really see this as a special move.

&#x200B;

Vision of Whydra

First Appearance: YouTube comments made me a better Swain player

Use: Thanks to the help of all Swain mains within Whydra Papa unlocked his 2nd move in The Communist Manifesto where he hits an enemy with his full power W changing the game according to his vision.

Fun Fact: Welcome to Swain's own set of special moves: The Communist Manifesto.

&#x200B;

Cold War

First Appearance: Game Changing Snipes

Use: With the help of a german science device, Papa shoots out icicles while in his ultimate form running at them with Appreach Velocity.

Fun fact: This is most likely be pretty low on the Tier List, not because it's bad but because it requires a full item.

&#x200B;

Death Defying Time Skip

First Appearance: Deadliest Weight

Use: With the help of an Ad Papa skips his own death

Fun Fact: Once again I am hesitant to even include this as it is more of a flashy way of using Tourettic Transition.

&#x200B;

Blighting Vasectomy

First Appearance: The Arrow of Retribution Returns

Use: Hitting an enemy with a fully charged Q while his W is up to completely destroy a far away enemy

Fun Fact: I'm almost at the end now BABY!

&#x200B;

Crippling Vasectomy

First Appearance: Autofilled Varus Mid

Use: Similar to Blighting Vasectomy but now with Flash added in for more range.

Fun Fact: The 2nd and last combo move in the series (so far) which will be higher on the tier list due to not requiring different 2 champions.

&#x200B;

Sniping Seizure

First Appearance: Sentinels of Light vs Shadow Isles

Use: Senna shoots a blast of combined Light and Darkness at a far away low hp enemy killing them with so much power that PaMa (Papa and Mama) undergoes a short seizure from the satisfaction.

Wie entkomme man auch als Zeuge Jehovas dem Zoom-Stress? Schon mal was von Zoom-Fatigue gehört?,"Ständig auf den Bildschirm starren, sich kaum bewegen, dauernd das eigene Spiegelbild sehen: Es gibt viele Gründe, warum Videokonferenzen ermüdend sein können – aber auch Strategien, wie sich das abmildern lässt.

Stundenlang in den Computer zu starren und die Kollegen in Form kleiner Bildchen vor sich zu sehen – das ist für viele Berufstätige inzwischen Alltag geworden. Zoomen ist inzwischen zum Oberbegriff geworden für die Veranstaltung von Videokonferenzen, unabhängig vom Anbieter. Doch der psychischen Gesundheit tut das Dauer-Zoomen nicht gut.

Immer öfter taucht in der Fachliteratur nämlich der Begriff der „Zoom-Fatigue“ auf: Die Betroffenen sind müde und erschöpft und fühlen sich überfordert. In einer Umfrage des Instituts für Beschäftigung und Employability in Ludwigshafen gaben zwei von drei der 330 Befragten – vor allem Führungskräfte und Personalmanager – an, sie würden Zoom-Fatigue spüren, mehr als jeder Achte immer und fast alle regelmäßig. Die Betroffenen klagten am häufigsten über Konzentrationsstörungen und das Gefühl, ungeduldig oder genervt zu sein.

Der Kommunikationswissenschaftler Jeremy Bailenson von der Universität Stanford in den USA hat kürzlich in einem Fachartikel vier Gründe beschrieben, warum das Zoomen so erschöpfen soll. Erstens: Man hat die Gesichter der Zoom-Partner immer sehr nah vor sich, was normalerweise nur passiert, wenn man jemanden gut kennt oder intim mit jemandem ist. Zoomt jemand nun stundenlang jeden Tag, ist das Hirn ständig in „Alarmbereitschaft“. Bailenson vergleicht es damit, als wären wir in einer überfüllten U-Bahn und alle würden uns direkt in die Augen schauen – dass das stressen kann, ist leicht vorstellbar.

Meetings kürzer gestalten
Der zweite Grund: Kognitive Überlastung, das heißt, wir müssen uns mehr anstrengen, um nonverbale Signale auszusenden und zu spüren. Stimmen wir den Argumenten eines Kollegen zu, nicken wir übertrieben, damit das auch alle sehen, oder wir halten den Daumen hoch in die Kamera. Studien weisen darauf hin, dass Menschen lauter in Videogesprächen reden – auch das strengt auf Dauer an. Wir sehen nur das höfliche Gesicht des Kollegen und kriegen nicht mit, dass er den Vorschlag blöd findet und aus Ablehnung die Arme verschränkt. Der dritte Erschöpfungsfaktor: Wir sehen uns ständig wie in einem Spiegel, und zwar in Form unseres kleinen Bildes in einer Ecke des Bildschirms.

Studien weisen darauf hin, dass Menschen, die sich selbst in Spiegeln oder Videos sehen, kritischer mit sich sind und eher negative Gefühle entwickelten. Der vierte Stressor: zu wenig Bewegung. Wir sitzen starr, meist nah vor dem Computer. In einem echten Meeting bewegen wir uns dagegen auf dem Stuhl hin und her, dehnen uns, tippen ins Tablet, gehen auf die Toilette oder holen uns einen Kaffee. Studien weisen darauf hin, dass Bewegung das Lernen und kreative Prozesse fördert. Zwar hindern uns Zooms nicht per se daran, uns zu bewegen oder zu gestikulieren. Aber dadurch, dass wir gezwungen sind, immer vor der Kamera zu sitzen und uns auf die Kommunikation zu konzentrieren, bewegen wir uns automatisch weniger. „Ich kann die Erklärungen des Stanford-Professors nachvollziehen“, sagt Kirsten Duelli, 47 Jahre alt und Marketing Manager bei einem Finanzdienstleister. „Zooms machen mich mitunter so müde, dass ich abends nur noch seichte Kriminalromane lesen mag – zu mehr ist mein Hirn nicht mehr fähig.“

Ständig sich und die anderen zu sehen stresse nicht nur, sondern lenke auch ab von den Inhalten des Meetings. Beim Kollegen, der kürzlich geheiratet hat, steht neuerdings eine kitschige Kristallvase auf der Fensterbank im Hintergrund – womöglich ein Geschenk von den Schwiegereltern? Und die Kollegin in den USA hat es offenbar der Desperate-Housewives-Darstellerin gleichgemacht und lässt jetzt ihre grauen Haare nachwachsen. Sind wohl schon acht Zentimeter auf jeder Seite, oder? Ups, was hat der Chef eben gefragt? Duelli hat täglich Zooms mit vier bis sechs Personen, manchmal zwölf und mehr. „Da schaut man automatisch zu jedem, der sich nur ein bisschen umsetzt oder mal einen Schluck trinkt“, sagt sie. „In einem Meetingraum realisiert mein Gehirn das zwar unbewusst, aber es nimmt nicht so viel Raum und damit Hirnleistung ein.“

Ihr berichte neuerdings fast jeder ihrer Klienten, sie würden unter den ständigen Zooms leiden, erzählt Jutta Boenig, Vorstandsvorsitzende der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Karriereberatung und Karrierecoach in Überlingen. „Der eine sagt, er fühle sich wie ein Zombie, die andere ausgequetscht wie eine Zitrone. Das Klagen hilft aber wenig. Im Sinne der Selbstfürsorge sollte man versuchen, sich vom Zoomen nicht stressen zu lassen.“ Das heißt: dem Chef klar sagen, dass man gerne zoomt, aber bitte mit einer halben Stunde Pause zwischen den Meetings. Von Unternehmensseite Vorgaben zum Zoomen machen: Zooms müssen regelmäßig von Pausen unterbrochen werden, jede Stunde etwa fünf bis zehn Minuten, wo sich jeder offline schaltet. Jeder Teilnehmer darf ab und zu mal sein Video ausschalten – schließlich schaut ja auch im echten Meeting niemand komisch, wenn man mal kurz aus dem Raum geht. „Und vor allem kritisch hinterfragen, ob jeder Zoom überhaupt notwendig ist“, sagt Boenig. „Will ich mit einem Geschäftspartner kurz etwas besprechen, muss ich das nicht per Video machen.“

Mehr telefonieren statt Video-Calls

Jeremy Bailenson gibt in seinem Artikel praktische Tipps: das kleine Fenster, das einen selbst zeigt, ausschalten oder es nach ein paar Sekunden von allein verschwinden lassen, wenn man gesehen hat, dass man gut dargestellt wird. Eine externe Kamera und eine externe Tastatur verwenden, damit man sich weiter wegsetzen und seine Sitzposition flexi­bler gestalten kann. „Nur Audio“-Zooms zum Standard machen oder noch besser: einfach wieder häufiger telefonieren.

All die Tipps können sicherlich nicht schaden, sagt Nico Dragano, Professor für Medizinische Soziologie an der Uniklinik Düsseldorf, „man muss aber das ganze Konzept der Zoom-Fatigue im Kontext sehen“. Bisher ist nicht bewiesen, ob die Erschöpfung durch das Zoomen zustande kommt oder ob es ein Faktor von vielen im Rahmen der wachsenden Digitalisierung ist. Der amerikanische Psychologe Craig Broad war einer der ersten Forscher, die in den 1980er-Jahren vermuteten, dass Computer Stress verursachen: „Technostress“.

Dieser kann mehrere Ursachen haben, unter anderem zu viel digitalen Input, Unverlässlichkeit von Computern mit ständigen Abstürzen, digitale Überwachung durch den Arbeitgeber, Herausforderung durch komplizierte Software und eine „Invasion“ der digitalen Welt in den Alltag, sodass die Grenzen zwischen Arbeit und Freizeit verschwimmen. Studien zeigen, dass sich bei Beschäftigten, die Technostress erfahren, eine Stressreaktion im Körper nachweisen lässt, etwa höhere Spiegel an Kortisol im Blut. Andere Untersuchungen zeigten Zusammenhänge zwischen Technostress und depressiven Symptomen oder Burnout. Es sei nicht auszuschließen, dass Zooms eine zusätzliche Techno-Belastung seien, sagt Dragano. „Aber bevor man arbeitsrechtliche Vorgaben macht – etwa die Zoom-Dauer pro Tag zu begrenzen oder Zoom-Pausen vorzuschreiben –, müsste man erst in Studien zeigen, dass das Zoomen wirklich ein unabhängiger Risikofaktor für Müdigkeit und Erschöpfung ist.“

„Fatigue“ – ein unglücklicher Begriff
Solche Studien sind vom Aufbau her nicht einfach. Man müsste über einen langen Zeitraum zwei Gruppen von Beschäftigten untersuchen, die einen arbeiten mit viel Computertechnologie und Zooms, die anderen mit wenig, und man würde schauen, wer wie erschöpft ist oder andere psychische Symptome entwickelt. In der Analyse müsse man zudem die vielen anderen Faktoren herausrechnen, die ebenfalls Erschöpfung und Stress verursachen können. „Womöglich kümmert sich ein Mitarbeiter gerade um seine pflegebedürftige Mutter und ist deshalb ständig müde und psychisch nicht gut drauf“, sagt Dragano. Das Zoomen könne dann der Tropfen sein, der das psychische Fass zum Überlaufen bringe. Abgesehen davon gibt es Dutzende medizinische Gründe, warum jemand müde und erschöpft ist, etwa Hormonstörungen, Herzkrankheiten oder ein Schlafapnoe-Syndrom.

Er finde zudem den Begriff der Zoom-Fatigue unglücklich gewählt, sagt Roger von Moos, Onkologe in der Schweiz und bis 2021 Präsident der Schweizerischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Klinische Krebsforschung. „Ich finde es fast schon despektierlich, hier von Fatigue zu reden“, sagt er. In der Medizin bedeutet Fatigue nämlich eine belastende Erschöpfung infolge von Krebs oder chronischen Krankheiten. Fatigue tritt plötzlich und ohne vorangegangene Anstrengung auf, hält lange an und ist durch Ausruhen und Schlaf nicht zu beheben. „Ich möchte die Erschöpfung nach stundenlangem Zoomen nicht kleinreden“, sagt von Moos. „Aber es ist etwas anderes, wenn ein schwerkranker Mensch dauernd erschöpft ist und nur eine langwierige Therapie helfen kann, die Symptome in den Griff zu bekommen.“

Unfallversicherung gegen Zoom-Fatigue?
Inzwischen hat sich auch die Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung (DGUV) des Themas angenommen und eine Broschüre auf ihrer Homepage veröffentlicht mit Erklärungen zu Ursachen, Symptomen und Maßnahmen. Das Thema sei gerade sehr aktuell, heißt es bei der DGUV auf die Frage für den Anlass der Broschüre. Sehr viele Beschäftigte würden lange und häufige Videokonferenzen nutzen und seien damit Belastungsfaktoren ausgesetzt. Das Angebot würde unter die Prävention arbeitsbedingter Gesundheitsgefahren fallen, was zu den Aufgaben der gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung gehöre.

Den gesundheitsschonenden Umgang mit Zooms muss jeder lernen, und dass Empfehlungen zur Prävention publiziert werden, finde ich gut“, sagt der Arzt Roger von Moos. „Aber dass das die Unfallversicherung macht, impliziert schon fast eine Berentung durch Zoom-Fatigue. Das finde ich absurd.“

Each Special move used in the entire series so far (As of Bites the Bush) in order,"Crippling Depression (Varus)

First Appearance: New Varus Build

Use: Buffering the Ultimate while flashing to get more range on it

Fun Fact: Varus' special move list is called The Arsenal of Abnormalities

&#x200B;

Psychotic Anxiety

First Appearance: Understanding Botlane

Use: Using flash to curve Pyke's e for style points or to gain more range to catch enemies just out of range

&#x200B;

Autism Zone

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Use: Allows Papa to increase his Chromosomes tenfold for a short amount of time but is useless unless Papa already has a large amount ready.

Fun Fact: The name was later changed to Asberger Syndrome due to Copyright and Papa wanting to make a callback to the Nexus Blitz filler episode and was changed to only be allowed to access one at 80% or more autism level.

&#x200B;

Forgotten Dememtia

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Use: Papa dashes with his E and uses his R to curve the phantom so it hits his opponent.

Fun fact: Papa's strongest solo move in his weapons of disorder. It is so strong that it cannot even be activated without a large source of chromosomes already present.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Pink Pyke Cloak

First Appearance: ppp

Use: While wearing the Pink Pink Cloak Papa gains the power of gayness becoming so powerful that no words in the human vocabulary can describe him forcing the narrator to go silent while Papa wrecks his enemies

Fun Fact: I will be including characters different forms on this List.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Blood Moon Pyke Skin

First Appearance: Blood Moon Pyke

Use: While in this form Papa's chromosome power is boosted however it requires a large amount of chromosomes to remain in this form.

Fun Fact: In order to gain access to this power Papa had to join the Blood Moon Clan and perform the ritual of paying the 5$ lifetime membership fee.

&#x200B;

Crippling Depression (Pyke)

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: Using flash to buffer the use on Pyke's q to get more range.

&#x200B;

Menacing Menpause

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: A 3 hit combo of Q, E backwards, Tiamat (or just a regular AA depending on the season) to proc Electrocute to get his target low enough for an execute with his R.

Fun Fact: This move probably changed the most during the series as its core component of Tiamat and sometimes even Electrocute were removed depending on how viable they were on Pyke. It is also the most usable of Pyke's Weapons of Disorder as it doesn't require flash or too many chromosomes.

&#x200B;

Epileptic Epitaph

First Appearance: Clean Combos

Use: Allows Papa to see 10 seconds into the future. Papa can spend more chromosomes to see farther. Papa must already be at high chromosome levels to use Epileptic Epitaph although the exact level vary based on different translations, manga, or anime.

Fun Fact: Although it first appeared in Clean Combos Epileptic Epitaph was only scarsley used in episodes like The Duty of a Carry, Tenacity Stacking etc. and it didn't even get its name until Auto win at level 16. (It was just called precognative ability until then).

&#x200B;

Chromosome Stealing

First Appearance: BAN SYLAS

Use: Being only usable by a select few characters It allows them to steal the chromosomes of other characters and gain the power of them.

Fun Fact: This ability was first used by Sylas and is the main reason he is my fav character. No other character (yes even Evil Morde and Evil Papa) made me feel so much dread when they appeared. The way he just ruthlessly stole WhyGuy's chromosomes still gives me chills each time i watch the episode. There are only 3 characters who have demonstrated having innatley having this ability (Sylas, Papa. Evil Papa).

&#x200B;

The Snap

First Appearance: Tenacity Stacking

Use: At the Cost of 50% of the League playerbase WhyGuy can skip his Promos. This only works if Papa has been in The Hardstuck Zone for atleast a month and if Papa recieves a comment asking for more cliffhangers.

&#x200B;

Shining Jaundice

First Appearance: Well Designed Item

Use: Using either the Stopwatch or Zhonya's Hourglass the user's skin becomes golden protecting them from any harm for 2.5.

Fun Fact: Anyone can use this special move and it was used throughout the entire series but first got a name in the episode Well Designed Item.

&#x200B;

Lazy Editing

First Appearance: Return to Masters

Use: At the cost of 88% Autism level WhyGuy can erase the process of a game skipping it entirely.

Fun Fact: Papa's most costly move which has only been used once in the entire series so far.

&#x200B;

Death Realm Warp

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: Usable only by the current Ruler of the Death realm (Currently Mordekaiser) it allowes them to warp themselves and 1 other person into the death realm for 1 on 1 combat within a confined space

Fun fact: It's time for most peoples favorite villain: Evil Mordekaiser! While I personally like Sylas more, the sheer power Mordekaiser presents from here on out towards the entire series unquestionably makes him a very close second.

&#x200B;

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (or ADHD for short)

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: A move created by Papa specifically to counter Morde's Death Realm Warp which puts his body in constant motion becoming UNCONTAINABLE.

Fun Fact: One of Papa's most worthless moves due to only being a counter to 1 specific thing makes this move very low on the Tier List (Yes I will be making a tier list after this) but the fact that someone forced Papa to create an entirely new move speaks volumes for Morde himself. What a shame that this move is very easily countered.

&#x200B;

Tourettic Transition

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: At the cost of Autism Levels Papa can skip anywhere betweeen 10 seconds and 20 minutes of a game.

Fun Fact: Like Epileptic Epitaph this ability appeared a long time before it actually got its name in Harvesting my adversaries with Dark Harvest Pyke.

&#x200B;

Crippling Anxiety

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: A combo move where Papa and Varus combine the moves Crippling Depression and Psychotic Anxiety to form a new even more powerful move.

Fun Fact: This is the very first combo move used in the series and I must say that it's pretty cool.

&#x200B;

Dead Weight

First Appearance: Mordekaiser's Revenge

Use: This move enhances the users desire to strategically iINT without getting banned

Fun Fact: This move is most often used in the series by villains and very rarely by allies of Whydra.

&#x200B;

Radiating Retardation

First Appearance: Dominating with Domination Runes

Use: The users chromosomes increase by 3 for every second that passes while in this state.

Fun Fact: This move can be techincally used even at low Autism Levels but due to it's high cost when you leave this state it's very unsafe to use it while below 90% Autism Levels.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Project Pyke Suit

First Appearance: PROJECT: Pyke

Use: When wearing this cybernetic form Papa stays at a permanent 80% Autism level and has a permanent Epileptic Epitaph installed. The suit also has a built-in casette player and a navigation assistant.

Fun Fact: Papa rarely uses this suit after its first appearance even after it was cleansed of the virus due to the fact that Papa prefers the risk of losing Autism levels for the reward of more than 80% than the safetey of a permanent 80%. Evil WhyGuy also wears a pink chroma on his suit to combine the powers of the PROJECT Suit and the ppc (Pink Pyke Cloak).

&#x200B;

Cybernetic Anxiety

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Psychotic Anxiety.

Fun Fact: We don't know which of the 2 moves is stronger but my guess is it depends on the amount of chromosomes the current user has.

&#x200B;

Technostressing Depression

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Crippling Depression.

&#x200B;

Diminishing Discrimination

First Appearnace: League of Legends makes me sad

Use: After landing her Q Mama smashes her keyboard with utmost finesse dealing massive damage and enlightening teammates that Supports should not be underestimated.

Fun Fact: Mama has decided that instead of focusing on various diffeerent moves for different situations she will just perfect 1 move that can be used in any situation. I am still sad that this means we will most likely never see the other moves in the Feminist Movement though (Whining Wamen, Bobcut buster, Entitled Endurance).

&#x200B;

Cultural Appropiration

First Appearance: Swain OP! Must ban instead of Pyke

Use: By becoming a bird himself Papa enducated uncultured 2 birds with his might showing them the power of Swain.

Fun Fact: I only put this on the list due to a YouTube comment as I don't even really see this as a special move.

&#x200B;

Vision of Whydra

First Appearance: YouTube comments made me a better Swain player

Use: Thanks to the help of all Swain mains within Whydra Papa unlocked his 2nd move in The Communist Manifesto where he hits an enemy with his full power W changing the game according to his vision.

Fun Fact: Welcome to Swain's own set of special moves: The Communist Manifesto.

&#x200B;

Cold War

First Appearance: Game Changing Snipes

Use: With the help of a german science device, Papa shoots out icicles while in his ultimate form running at them with Appreach Velocity.

Fun fact: This is most likely be pretty low on the Tier List, not because it's bad but because it requires a full item.

&#x200B;

Death Defying Time Skip

First Appearance: Deadliest Weight

Use: With the help of an Ad Papa skips his own death

Fun Fact: Once again I am hesitant to even include this as it is more of a flashy way of using Tourettic Transition.

&#x200B;

Blighting Vasectomy

First Appearance: The Arrow of Retribution Returns

Use: Hitting an enemy with a fully charged Q while his W is up to completely destroy a far away enemy

Fun Fact: I'm almost at the end now BABY!

&#x200B;

Crippling Vasectomy

First Appearance: Autofilled Varus Mid

Use: Similar to Blighting Vasectomy but now with Flash added in for more range.

Fun Fact: The 2nd and last combo move in the series (so far) which will be higher on the tier list due to not requiring different 2 champions.

&#x200B;

Sniping Seizure

First Appearance: Sentinels of Light vs Shadow Isles

Use: Senna shoots a blast of combined Light and Darkness at a far away low hp enemy killing them with so much power that PaMa (Papa and Mama) undergoes a short seizure from the satisfaction.

Fun Fact: Last move probably for a while folks.

&#x200B;

Reverse Your Kill

First Appearance: Insane Healing with Fleet Footwork

Use: Using Piercing darkness while imbued with the power of Fleet Footwork, taste of Blood and Adent Censer, Senna overcomes the weakness of being squishy with massive healing powers.

Fun Fact: Like the move but the episode it came it gave me very mixed feelings (look at my comment in the video for that). Also I am working on the tier list but would enjoy multiple views so anyone who wants to work together with me on this is welcome to send me a message or comment and we can work together.

&#x200B;

Wildfire Windup

First Appearance: AP Maokai with Ocean Rift is Free Win

Use: A combo of TreeGuy's non-ultimate abilities starting with Twisted Advance, Brambly Smashing his target near his Sapling burning the target's body on a molecular level so fast like a Wildfire

First Appearance: AP Maokai with Ocean Rift is Free Win

&#x200B;

Rheumatic Roots

First Appearance: AP Maokai with Ocean Rift is Free Win

Use: Using Nate's Grasp out of vision to catch the enemy off guard and root 3 or more enemies.

Fun Fact: This move is best used when contesting Objectives.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Amazon Bushfire

First Appearance: Bites the Bush

Use: Used by Evil Papa to burn the entire Rift reducing the amount of bushes and limiting TreeGuy's power.

Fun Fact: Another passive ability that I will once again include in the tier list.

&#x200B;

Bites the Bush

First Appearance: Bites the Bush

Use: Using Epileptic Epitaph Papa forsees someone entering a specific bush at low health and plants a Sapling in preparation to utterly annihilate them.

Fun Fact: This easily lands in my top 5 moves just for the amazing effects the anime used to show it's power.

&#x200B;

Psychotic Assault

First Appearance: Getting my Pyke back in shape

Use: A variation of Psychotic Anxiety where he hits someone with his q before his e to do more damage.

Fun Fact: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Each Special move used in the entire series so far (As of Just Sett Things... (D1 Promos)) in order.," Crippling Depression (Varus)

First Appearance: New Varus Build

Use: Buffering the Ultimate while flashing to get more range on it

Fun Fact: Varus' special move list is called The Arsenal of Abnormalities

&#x200B;

Psychotic Anxiety

First Appearance: Understanding Botlane

Use: Using flash to curve Pyke's e for style points or to gain more range to catch enemies just out of range

&#x200B;

Autism Zone

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Use: Allows Papa to increase his Chromosomes tenfold for a short amount of time but is useless unless Papa already has a large amount ready.

Fun Fact: The name was later changed to Asberger Syndrome due to Copyright and Papa wanting to make a callback to the Nexus Blitz filler episode and was changed to only be allowed to access one at 80% or more autism level.

&#x200B;

Forgotten Dememtia

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Use: Papa dashes with his E and uses his R to curve the phantom so it hits his opponent.

Fun fact: Papa's strongest solo move in his weapons of disorder. It is so strong that it cannot even be activated without a large source of chromosomes already present.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Pink Pyke Cloak

First Appearance: ppp

Use: While wearing the Pink Pink Cloak Papa gains the power of gayness becoming so powerful that no words in the human vocabulary can describe him forcing the narrator to go silent while Papa wrecks his enemies

Fun Fact: I will be including characters different forms on this List.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Blood Moon Pyke Skin

First Appearance: Blood Moon Pyke

Use: While in this form Papa's chromosome power is boosted however it requires a large amount of chromosomes to remain in this form.

Fun Fact: In order to gain access to this power Papa had to join the Blood Moon Clan and perform the ritual of paying the 5$ lifetime membership fee.

&#x200B;

Crippling Depression (Pyke)

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: Using flash to buffer the use on Pyke's q to get more range.

&#x200B;

Menacing Menpause

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: A 3 hit combo of Q, E backwards, Tiamat (or just a regular AA depending on the season) to proc Electrocute to get his target low enough for an execute with his R.

Fun Fact: This move probably changed the most during the series as its core component of Tiamat and sometimes even Electrocute were removed depending on how viable they were on Pyke. It is also the most usable of Pyke's Weapons of Disorder as it doesn't require flash or too many chromosomes.

&#x200B;

Epileptic Epitaph

First Appearance: Clean Combos

Use: Allows Papa to see 10 seconds into the future. Papa can spend more chromosomes to see farther. Papa must already be at high chromosome levels to use Epileptic Epitaph although the exact level vary based on different translations, manga, or anime.

Fun Fact: Although it first appeared in Clean Combos Epileptic Epitaph was only scarsley used in episodes like The Duty of a Carry, Tenacity Stacking etc. and it didn't even get its name until Auto win at level 16. (It was just called precognative ability until then).

&#x200B;

Chromosome Stealing

First Appearance: BAN SYLAS

Use: Being only usable by a select few characters It allows them to steal the chromosomes of other characters and gain the power of them.

Fun Fact: This ability was first used by Sylas and is the main reason he is my fav character. No other character (yes even Evil Morde and Evil Papa) made me feel so much dread when they appeared. The way he just ruthlessly stole WhyGuy's chromosomes still gives me chills each time i watch the episode. There are only 3 characters who have demonstrated having innatley having this ability (Sylas, Papa. Evil Papa).

&#x200B;

The Snap

First Appearance: Tenacity Stacking

Use: At the Cost of 50% of the League playerbase WhyGuy can skip his Promos. This only works if Papa has been in The Hardstuck Zone for atleast a month and if Papa recieves a comment asking for more cliffhangers.

&#x200B;

Shining Jaundice

First Appearance: Well Designed Item

Use: Using either the Stopwatch or Zhonya's Hourglass the user's skin becomes golden protecting them from any harm for 2.5.

Fun Fact: Anyone can use this special move and it was used throughout the entire series but first got a name in the episode Well Designed Item.

&#x200B;

Lazy Editing

First Appearance: Return to Masters

Use: At the cost of 88% Autism level WhyGuy can erase the process of a game skipping it entirely.

Fun Fact: Papa's most costly move which has only been used once in the entire series so far.

&#x200B;

Death Realm Warp

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: Usable only by the current Ruler of the Death realm (Currently Mordekaiser) it allowes them to warp themselves and 1 other person into the death realm for 1 on 1 combat within a confined space

Fun fact: It's time for most peoples favorite villain: Evil Mordekaiser! While I personally like Sylas more, the sheer power Mordekaiser presents from here on out towards the entire series unquestionably makes him a very close second.

&#x200B;

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (or ADHD for short)

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: A move created by Papa specifically to counter Morde's Death Realm Warp which puts his body in constant motion becoming UNCONTAINABLE.

Fun Fact: One of Papa's most worthless moves due to only being a counter to 1 specific thing makes this move very low on the Tier List (Yes I will be making a tier list after this) but the fact that someone forced Papa to create an entirely new move speaks volumes for Morde himself. What a shame that this move is very easily countered.

&#x200B;

Tourettic Transition

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: At the cost of Autism Levels Papa can skip anywhere betweeen 10 seconds and 20 minutes of a game.

Fun Fact: Like Epileptic Epitaph this ability appeared a long time before it actually got its name in Harvesting my adversaries with Dark Harvest Pyke.

&#x200B;

Crippling Anxiety

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: A combo move where Papa and Varus combine the moves Crippling Depression and Psychotic Anxiety to form a new even more powerful move.

Fun Fact: This is the very first combo move used in the series and I must say that it's pretty cool.

&#x200B;

Dead Weight

First Appearance: Mordekaiser's Revenge

Use: This move enhances the users desire to strategically iINT without getting banned

Fun Fact: This move is most often used in the series by villains and very rarely by allies of Whydra.

&#x200B;

Radiating Retardation

First Appearance: Dominating with Domination Runes

Use: The users chromosomes increase by 3 for every second that passes while in this state.

Fun Fact: This move can be techincally used even at low Autism Levels but due to it's high cost when you leave this state it's very unsafe to use it while below 90% Autism Levels.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Project Pyke Suit

First Appearance: PROJECT: Pyke

Use: When wearing this cybernetic form Papa stays at a permanent 80% Autism level and has a permanent Epileptic Epitaph installed. The suit also has a built-in casette player and a navigation assistant.

Fun Fact: Papa rarely uses this suit after its first appearance even after it was cleansed of the virus due to the fact that Papa prefers the risk of losing Autism levels for the reward of more than 80% than the safetey of a permanent 80%. Evil WhyGuy also wears a pink chroma on his suit to combine the powers of the PROJECT Suit and the ppc (Pink Pyke Cloak).

&#x200B;

Cybernetic Anxiety

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Psychotic Anxiety.

Fun Fact: We don't know which of the 2 moves is stronger but my guess is it depends on the amount of chromosomes the current user has.

&#x200B;

Technostressing Depression

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Crippling Depression.

&#x200B;

Diminishing Discrimination

First Appearnace: League of Legends makes me sad

Use: After landing her Q Mama smashes her keyboard with utmost finesse dealing massive damage and enlightening teammates that Supports should not be underestimated.

Fun Fact: Mama has decided that instead of focusing on various diffeerent moves for different situations she will just perfect 1 move that can be used in any situation. I am still sad that this means we will most likely never see the other moves in the Feminist Movement though (Whining Wamen, Bobcut buster, Entitled Endurance).

&#x200B;

Cultural Appropiration

First Appearance: Swain OP! Must ban instead of Pyke

Use: By becoming a bird himself Papa enducated uncultured 2 birds with his might showing them the power of Swain.

Fun Fact: I only put this on the list due to a YouTube comment as I don't even really see this as a special move.

&#x200B;

Vision of Whydra

First Appearance: YouTube comments made me a better Swain player

Use: Thanks to the help of all Swain mains within Whydra Papa unlocked his 2nd move in The Communist Manifesto where he hits an enemy with his full power W changing the game according to his vision.

Fun Fact: Welcome to Swain's own set of special moves: The Communist Manifesto.

&#x200B;

Cold War

First Appearance: Game Changing Snipes

Use: With the help of a german science device, Papa shoots out icicles while in his ultimate form running at them with Appreach Velocity.

Fun fact: This is most likely be pretty low on the Tier List, not because it's bad but because it requires a full item.

&#x200B;

Death Defying Time Skip

First Appearance: Deadliest Weight

Use: With the help of an Ad Papa skips his own death

Fun Fact: Once again I am hesitant to even include this as it is more of a flashy way of using Tourettic Transition.

&#x200B;

Blighting Vasectomy

First Appearance: The Arrow of Retribution Returns

Use: Hitting an enemy with a fully charged Q while his W is up to completely destroy a far away enemy

Fun Fact: I'm almost at the end now BABY!

&#x200B;

Crippling Vasectomy

First Appearance: Autofilled Varus Mid

Use: Similar to Blighting Vasectomy but now with Flash added in for more range.

Fun Fact: The 2nd and last combo move in the series (so far) which will be higher on the tier list due to not requiring different 2 champions.

&#x200B;

Sniping Seizure

First Appearance: Sentinels of Light vs Shadow Isles

Use: Senna shoots a blast of combined Light and Darkness at a far away low hp enemy killing them with so much power that PaMa (Papa and Mama) undergoes a short seizure from the satisfaction.

Fun Fact: Last move probably for a while folks.

&#x200B;

Reverse Your Kill

First Appearance: Insane Healing with Fleet Footwork

Use: Using Piercing darkness while imbued with the power of Fleet Footwork, taste of Blood and Adent Censer, Senna overcomes the weakness of being squishy with massive healing powers.

Fun Fact: Like the move but the episode it came it gave me very mixed feelings (look at my comment in the video for that). Also I am working on the tier list but would enjoy multiple views so anyone who wants to work together with me on this is welcome to send me a message or comment and we can work together.

&#x200B;

Wildfire Windup

First Appearance: AP Maokai with Ocean Rift is Free Win

Use: A combo of TreeGuy's non-ultimate abilities starting with Twisted Advance, Brambly Smashing his target near his Sapling burning the target's body on a molecular level so fast like a Wildfire

Fun Fact: Behold TreeGuy's special moves: The Armaments of Nature!

&#x200B;

Forest Grump

First Appearance: AP Maokai with Ocean Rift is Free Win

Use: TreeGuy's version of Crippling Depression where he flashes and then Twisted Advances for a suprise root.

Fun fact: These moves are the bane of my existence as now i have to update it again.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Reforest Frustration

First Appearance: AP Maokai with Ocean Rift is Free Win

Use: A passive ability where WhyGuy's chomosomes sync with nature giving him more options to plant empowered saplings while frustrating his enemies.

Fun Fact: I'm gonna be including it in the tier list even though it's a passive ability because it's my list and I make the rules.

&#x200B;

Rheumatic Roots

First Appearance: AP Maokai with Ocean Rift is Free Win

Use: Using Nate's Grasp out of vision to catch the enemy off guard and root 3 or more enemies.

Fun Fact: This move is best used when contesting Objectives.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Amazon Bushfire

First Appearance: Bites the Bush

Use: Used by Evil Papa to burn the entire Rift reducing the amount of bushes and limiting TreeGuy's power.

Fun Fact: Another passive ability that I will once again include in the tier list.

&#x200B;

Bites the Bush

First Appearance: Bites the Bush

Use: Using Epileptic Epitaph Papa forsees someone entering a specific bush at low health and plants a Sapling in preparation to utterly annihilate them.

Fun Fact: This easily lands in my top 5 moves just for the amazing effects the anime used to show it's power.

&#x200B;

Psychotic Assault

First Appearance: Getting my Pyke back in shape

Use: A variation of Psychotic Anxiety where he hits someone with his q before his e to do more damage.

Fun Fact: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

&#x200B;

Autism Zone

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Fun Fact: The name was later changed to Asberger Syndrome due to Copyright and Papa wanting to make a callback to the Nexus Blitz filler episode and was changed to only be allowed to access one at 80% or more autism level.

&#x200B;

Forgotten Dememtia

First Appearance: Lethality Pyke

Use: Papa dashes with his E and uses his R to curve the phantom so it hits his opponent.

Fun fact: Papa's strongest solo move in his weapons of disorder. It is so strong that it cannot even be activated without a large source of chromosomes already present.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Pink Pyke Cloak

First Appearance: ppp

Use: While wearing the Pink Pink Cloak Papa gains the power of gayness becoming so powerful that no words in the human vocabulary can describe him forcing the narrator to go silent while Papa wrecks his enemies

&#x200B;

Fun Fact: I will be including characters different forms on this List.

(Not a special move) Blood Moon Pyke Skin

First Appearance: Blood Moon Pyke

Use: While in this form Papa's chromosome power is boosted however it requires a large amount of chromosomes to remain in this form.

Fun Fact: In order to gain access to this power Papa had to join the Blood Moon Clan and perform the ritual of paying the 5$ lifetime membership fee.

&#x200B;

Crippling Depression (Pyke)

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: Using flash to buffer the use on Pyke's q to get more range.

&#x200B;

Menacing Menpause

First Appearance: Pyke is very weak and definitely needs the buffs. Thank you League of Legends!

Use: A 3 hit combo of Q, E backwards, Tiamat (or just a regular AA depending on the season) to proc Electrocute to get his target low enough for an execute with his R.

Fun Fact: This move probably changed the most during the series as its core component of Tiamat and sometimes even Electrocute were removed depending on how viable they were on Pyke. It is also the most usable of Pyke's Weapons of Disorder as it doesn't require flash or too many chromosomes.

&#x200B;

Epileptic Epitaph

First Appearance: Clean Combos

Use: Allows Papa to see 10 seconds into the future. Papa can spend more chromosomes to see farther. Papa must already be at high chromosome levels to use Epileptic Epitaph although the exact level vary based on different translations, manga, or anime.

Fun Fact: Although it first appeared in Clean Combos Epileptic Epitaph was only scarsley used in episodes like The Duty of a Carry, Tenacity Stacking etc. and it didn't even get its name until Auto win at level 16. (It was just called precognative ability until then).

&#x200B;

Chromosome Stealing

First Appearance: BAN SYLAS

Use: Being only usable by a select few characters It allows them ti steal the chromosomes of other characters and gain the power of them.

Fun Fact: This ability was first used by Sylas and is the main reason he is my fav character. No other character (yes even Evil Morde and Evil Papa) made me feel so much dread when they appeared. The way he just ruthlessly stole WhyGuy's chromosomes still gives me chills each time i watch the episode. There are only 3 characters who have demonstrated having innatley having this ability (Sylas, Papa. Evil Papa).

&#x200B;

The Snap

First Appearance: Tenacity Stacking

Use: At the Cost of 50% of the League playerbase WhyGuy can skip his Promos. This only works if Papa has been in The Hardstuck Zone for atleast a month and if Papa recieves a comment asking for more cliffhangers.

&#x200B;

Shining Jaundice

First Appearance: Well Designed Item

Use: Using either the Stopwatch or Zhonya's Hourglass the user's skin becomes golden protecting them from any harm for 2.5.

Fun Fact: Anyone can use this special move and it was used throughout the entire series but first got a name in the episode Well Designed Item.

&#x200B;

Lazy Editing

First Appearance: Return to Masters

Use: At the cost of 88% Autism level WhyGuy can erase the process of a game skipping it entirely.

Fun Fact: Papa's most costly move which has only been used once in the entire series so far.

&#x200B;

Death Realm Warp

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: Usable only by the current Ruler of the Death realm (Currently Mordekaiser) it allowes them to warp themselves and 1 other person into the death realm for 1 on 1 combat within a confined space

Fun fact: It's time for most peoples favorite villain: Evil Mordekaiser! While I personally like Sylas more, the sheer power Mordekaiser presents from here on out towards the entire series unquestionably makes him a very close second.

&#x200B;

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (or ADHD for short)

First Appearance: Well Designed Rework

Use: A move created by Papa specifically to counter Morde's Death Realm Warp which puts his body in constant motion becoming UNCONTAINABLE.

Fun Fact: One of Papa's most worthless moves due to only being a counter to 1 specific thing makes this move very low on the Tier List (Yes I will be making a tier list after this) but the fact that someone forced Papa to create an entirely new move speaks volumes for Morde himself. What a shame that this move is very easily countered.

&#x200B;

Tourettic Transition

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: At the cost of Autism Levels Papa can skip anywhere betweeen 10 seconds and 20 minutes of a game.

Fun Fact: Like Epileptic Epitaph this ability appeared a long time before it actually got its name in Harvesting my adversaries with Dark Harvest Pyke.

&#x200B;

Crippling Anxiety

First Appearance: Pyka and Sona Bot Lane

Use: A combo move where Papa and Varus combine the moves Crippling Depression and Psychotic Anxiety to form a new even more powerful move.

Fun Fact: This is the very first combo move used in the series and I must say that it's pretty cool.

&#x200B;

Dead Weight

First Appearance: Mordekaiser's Revenge

Use: This move enhances the users desire to strategically iINT without getting banned

Fun Fact: This move is most often used in the series by villains and very rarely by allies of Whydra.

&#x200B;

Radiating Retardation

First Appearance: Dominating with Domination Runes

Use: The users chromosomes increase by 3 for every second that passes while in this state.

Fun Fact: This move can be techincally used even at low Autism Levels but due to it's high cost when you leave this state it's very unsafe to use it while below 90% Autism Levels.

&#x200B;

(Not a special move) Project Pyke Suit

First Appearance: PROJECT: Pyke

Use: When wearing this cybernetic form Papa stays at a permanent 80% Autism level and has a permanent Epileptic Epitaph installed. The suit also has a built-in casette player and a navigation assistant.

Fun Fact: Papa rarely uses this suit after its first appearance even after it was cleansed of the virus due to the fact that Papa prefers the risk of losing Autism levels for the reward of more than 80% than the safetey of a permanent 80%. Evil WhyGuy also wears a pink chroma on his suit to combine the powers of the PROJECT Suit and the ppc (Pink Pyke Cloak).

&#x200B;

Cybernetic Anxiety

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Psychotic Anxiety.

Fun Fact: We don't know which of the 2 moves is stronger but my guess is it depends on the amount of chromosomes the current user has.

&#x200B;

Technostressing Depression

First Appearance: Mama vs Papa of Realm 51

Use: PROJECT Pyke's version of Crippling Depression.

&#x200B;

Diminishing Discrimination

First Appearnace: League of Legends makes me sad

Use: After landing her Q Mama smashes her keyboard with utmost finesse dealing massive damage and enlightening teammates that Supports should not be underestimated.

Fun Fact: Mama has decided that instead of focusing on various diffeerent moves for different situations she will just perfect 1 move that can be used in any situation. I am still sad that this means we will most likely never see the other moves in the Feminist Movement though (Whining Wamen, Bobcut buster, Entitled Endurance).

&#x200B;

Cultural Appropiration

First Appearance: Swain OP! Must ban instead of Pyke

Use: By becoming a bird himself Papa enducated uncultured 2 birds with his might showing them the power of Swain.

Fun Fact: I only put this on the list due to a YouTube comment as I don't even really see this as a special move.

&#x200B;

Vision of Whydra

First Appearance: YouTube comments made me a better Swain player

Use: Thanks to the help of all Swain mains within Whydra Papa unlocked his 2nd move in The Communist Manifesto where he hits an enemy with his full power W changing the game according to his vision.

Fun Fact: Welcome to Swain's own set of special moves: The Communist Manifesto.

&#x200B;

Cold War

First Appearance: Game Changing Snipes

Use: With the help of a german science device, Papa shoots out icicles while in his ultimate form running at them with Appreach Velocity.

Fun fact: This is most likely be pretty low on the Tier List, not because it's bad but because it requires a full item.

&#x200B;

Death Defying Time Skip

First Appearance: Deadliest Weight

Use: With the help of an Ad Papa skips his own death

Fun Fact: Once again I am hesitant to even include this as it is more of a flashy way of using Tourettic Transition.

&#x200B;

Blighting Vasectomy

First Appearance: The Arrow of Retribution Returns

Use: Hitting an enemy with a fully charged Q while his W is up to completely destroy a far away enemy

Fun Fact: I'm almost at the end now BABY!

&#x200B;

Crippling Vasectomy

First Appearance: Autofilled Varus Mid

Use: Similar to Blighting Vasectomy but now with Flash added in for more range.

Fun Fact: The 2nd and last combo move in the series (so far) which will be higher on the tier list due to not requiring different 2 champions.

&#x200B;

Sniping Seizure

First Appearance: Sentinels of Light vs Shadow Isles

Use: Senna shoots a blast of combined Light and Darkness at a far away low hp enemy killing them with so much power that PaMa (Papa and Mama) undergoes a short seizure from the satisfaction.

Fun Fact: Last move probably for a while folks.

&#x200B;

Reverse Your Kill

First Appearance: Insane Healing with Fleet Footwork

Use: Using Piercing darkness while imbued with the power of Fleet Footwork, taste of Blood and Adent Censer, Senna overcomes the weakness of being squishy with massive healing powers.

Fun Fact: Like the move but the episode it came it gave me very mixed feelings (look at my comment in the video for that). Also I am working on the tier list but would enjoy multiple views so anyone who wants to work together with me on this is welcome to send me a message or comment and we can work together.

Antwoord op vragen van het lid Gijs van Dijk over het recht op onbereikbaarheid,"^(Vragen van het lid Gijs van Dijk &#40;PvdA&#41; aan de staatssecretaris van Sociale  
Zaken en Werkgelegenheid over het recht op onbereikbaarheid &#40;ingezonden 6  
september 2018&#41;  
&nbsp;    
1  
Bent u bekend met het artikel ‘Lidl pakt intern e-mailen aan: 's avonds en  
in weekend komen mails niet aan’?[1]  
&nbsp;    
Ja.  
   
2  
Deelt u de mening dat stress- en burn-outklachten bij werknemers een van de  
grootste ziekmakers is? Bent u ook van mening dat het nog steeds van belang  
is om de gevaren van werkstress onder de aandacht te brengen bij werknemers  
en werkgevers? Wat is daarom de overweging om te stoppen met de  
bewustwordingscampagne over werkstress?  
&nbsp;    
Uit onderzoek van TNO blijkt dat psychosociale arbeidsbelasting de grootste  
oorzaak van ziekte door werk is &#40;NEA 2017[2]&#41;. Een hoge werkdruk,  
ongewenste omgangsvormen als pesten, seksuele intimidatie en agressie en  
geweld zijn voorbeelden van zaken die kunnen leiden tot stress en burn-out.  
Het ministerie van SZW heeft de afgelopen jaren intensief ingezet op  
bewustwording rond werkstress onder werkgevers en werknemers en heeft hen  
ondersteund bij het nemen van maatregelen, onder meer door het verspreiden  
en ontwikkelen van goede voorbeelden en handreikingen. Met deze  
bewustwordingscampagne is ingezet op agendering, nu komt het erop aan om  
concrete verbeteringen binnen organisaties te realiseren. Dit is ook al  
steeds vaker het geval. In 2014 nam 69% van de werkgevers maatregelen op  
dit gebied, in 2016 was dit 77%[3]. Maar we zijn er nog niet.  
&nbsp;    
Het is aan werkgevers en werknemers om continu met elkaar in gesprek te  
zijn en waar nodig actie te ondernemen om werkstress te voorkomen. Dit  
blijf ik ondersteunen met gerichte activiteiten. Bijvoorbeeld door  
relevante instrumenten en informatie te delen via het Arboportaal, het  
organiseren van bijeenkomsten rondom ongewenst gedrag op het werk in het  
najaar en diverse activiteiten ter ondersteuning van de rol en positie van  
vertrouwenspersonen. Tevens laat ik onderzoek uitvoeren op het gebied van  
gedragscodes en naar de oorzaken van de verhoogde kans op burn-out bij een  
aantal groepen. Daarnaast ondersteun ik de branche-organisatie OVAL  
&#40;Organisatie voor Vitaliteit, Activering en Loopbaan&#41; en TNO die dit jaar  
gezamenlijk de Week van de Werkstress organiseren, om ook bewustwording te  
blijven stimuleren.  
&nbsp;    
3  
Deelt u verder de mening dat de toename van stress- en burn-outklachten  
onder andere komt door de toenemende druk om continue bereikbaar te zijn?  
&nbsp;    
Mijn inschatting is dat dit hieraan bij zou kunnen dragen, maar concrete  
cijfers hierover zijn mij niet bekend. In 2017 heeft TNO, in overleg met  
mijn ministerie, een verkennende studie[4] gedaan naar het onderwerp  
technostress. Dit onderzoek heeft aan de hand van een aantal experts de  
problematiek verkend. Causale relaties zijn nog niet aangetoond.   
4  
Hoe kijkt u aan tegen het recht op onbereikbaarheid zoals bij Lidl in  
België en Luxemburg of bij BMW en Volkswagen in Duitsland wordt ingevoerd?  
Bent u bereid om met voorlopende bedrijven in Nederland in gesprek te gaan  
om te kijken of zij een voorbeeldrol kunnen aannemen?  
&nbsp;    
5  
Constaterende dat er in Frankrijk een wettelijk recht op onbereikbaarheid  
bestaat, bent u bereid om te onderzoeken of een dergelijk recht op  
onbereikbaarheid ook voor Nederlandse werknemers een manier is om stress  
tegen te gaan? Bent u bovendien bereid om het recht op onbereikbaarheid met  
sociale partners te bespreken?  
&nbsp;    
Antwoord op vragen 4 en 5  
Een aanpak tegen werkstress is maatwerk. Maatregelen zoals Lidl die in  
België en Luxemburg heeft genomen, kunnen een manier zijn om met  
technostress om te gaan, maar dit hoeft niet bij alle werkgevers en voor  
alle werknemers de oplossing te zijn.  
&nbsp;    
Ik juich het toe als werkgevers en werknemers gezamenlijk in gesprek zijn  
en blijven en komen tot effectieve maatregelen. Ook als het gaat om  
technostress zal deze dialoog vooral gevoerd moeten worden op de werkvloer.  
Het onderzoek van TNO uit 2017 geeft aan dat in deze tijd werkgevers en  
werknemers ‘in co-creatie’ zouden moeten zoeken naar afleidingsvrije  
momenten en gezamenlijk heldere afspraken zouden moeten maken over omgang  
met e-mail en smartphones. Want, zoals het rapport stelt, het gaat  
bijvoorbeeld bij de druk om altijd maar online te zijn vaak niet om  
daadwerkelijke regels, maar om aannames en verwachtingen, zonder dat hier  
het gesprek over wordt gevoerd.  
Een gesprek hierover met de sociale partners lijkt mij niet aangewezen. De  
sociale partners kunnen wel bevorderen dat werkgevers en werknemers  
hierover met elkaar in gesprek gaan.

Kunt u deze vragen beantwoorden voor het debat over de toename van het  
aantal mensen met een burn-out?  
&nbsp;    
Ja.

[2] Jaarlijks voeren TNO en CBS, in samenwerking met het ministerie van  
SZW, de nationale enquête arbeidsomstandigheden &#40;NEA&#41; uit onder zo’n 42.000  
werknemers. Deze enquête geeft een goed inzicht in de psychosociale  
arbeidsbelasting zoals deze door werknemers wordt ervaren, en hoe dit zich  
onder meer uit in burn-out klachten. Voor de laatste cijfers zie de NEA  
2017, gepubliceerd op 20 april 2018.
